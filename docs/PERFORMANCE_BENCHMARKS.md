## Comparison with Manual Traversal System

### Implementation Comparison

| Approach | Execution Order | Performance | Maintainability |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Manual Traversal** | Hard-coded sequential | ~700ms (full install) | Brittle, error-prone |
| **DAG-based** | Computed topological | ~650ms (full install) | Robust, flexible |

### Execution Order Analysis

**Manual Order (13 steps):**
```
[CheckPrerequisites, ScanExistingFiles, CreateBackups, CheckTargetDirectory, 
 CloneRepository, CreateDirectoryStructure, CopyCoreFiles, CopyCommandFiles, 
 MergeOrCreateCLAUDEmd, CreateCommandSymlink, MergeOrCreateMCPConfig, 
 ValidateInstallation, CleanupTempFiles]
```

**DAG Order (13 steps):**
```
[CheckPrerequisites, ScanExistingFiles, CreateBackups, CheckTargetDirectory, 
 CloneRepository, CreateDirectoryStructure, MergeOrCreateCLAUDEmd, CopyCoreFiles, 
 CopyCommandFiles, MergeOrCreateMCPConfig, CreateCommandSymlink, 
 ValidateInstallation, CleanupTempFiles]
```

**Key Differences:**
- DAG correctly sequences MergeOrCreateCLAUDEmd before file copy operations
